            "The systemic approach becomes critical because DesignOps delivers business impact on multiple levels — speed to delivery, quality of output, time to market, spending efficiencies, increased ROI… — to multiple stakeholders, from the designers to the cross-functional partners, making DesignOps a systemic discipline. Moreover, Design’s positioning as a cross-functional and collaborative discipline that relies on ongoing relationships with other non-design partners reinforces the systemic nature of DesignOps and the needs to include Systems Thinking among the success criteria of any transformational initiative.\n",
            "\n",
            "If DesignOps’ focus is to improve operational and spending efficiencies and to maximise value creation, DesignOps needs to understand the inter-relations and the deep connections among the parts of the system to exploit those relationships to enable benefits to propagate within the sub-systems and the organisation.\n",

It seemed like I was the only person in the room who definitely wasn’t straight and who knew anything about trans* issues, so I found myself speaking up a lot in class (and getting a lot of weird looks from my classmates). During that class, the professor informed us of a performer called Yozmit. The professor really struggled with describing her and using her pronouns because her philosophy of gender was incredibly abstract. In class, we listened to her song Sound of New P*ssy (censored because I’m not sure what the rules are on Medium for that kind of language).\n",

            "\n",
            "Suffice to say that most people in the social circle I was outed to were not the most accepting. I was called names. Jokes with slurs were thrown around. I was interrogated about issues like “trans women in women’s sports.” It was heavily implied that I was mentally ill or confused. They didn’t know how to see me as nonbinary so I was misgendered constantly (I still am sometimes, to be honest).\n",
            "\n",
            "And it was so frustrating because the only terms I could get them to understand were in the binary.

            "\n",
            "So I started defining myself in those terms. I started trying to alter my voice to be more consistent with the “opposite” gender.

            "\n",
            "Like a light switch had gone off, I was suddenly being gendered correctly.

            "\n",
            "Suddenly, I was a transmasculine/feminine nonbinary person. Sorry if that’s confusing, but I’ve said that I will not be disclosing my assigned gender at birth (agab) and I plan on sticking to it- fill in the previous with either transmasculine or transfeminine and you get the idea.\n",
            "\n",
            "And at first, that went really well with me. I’m not an agender person, I do definitely have a feeling of gender (even if it isn’t much of one), and it definitely leans a little bit towards either masculine or feminine. I actually felt empowered by it for a while. I was being recognized! I wasn’t being misgendered really anymore! I had found phrases that they understood!\n",

            "Then the invasive questions started. Was I getting surgeries? Was I starting hormones? In social situations I was still considered “one of the girls” or “one of the guys” (the one that correlated with my agab).

            "\n",
            "I started feeling tired. I remembered what it was like to pretend to be cisgender for those years that I knew I was nonbinary initially and this feeling was exactly the same. I was pretending so much to be so like the “opposite” gender for their comfort that I wasn’t being myself.\n",
            "\n",

            "There are nonbinary men and women, and I don’t mean to discount them, but that experience is not all of our experience. If a friend comes out to you as nonbinary and you automatically start using “opposite” gendered words for them you are not being a good ally. You are preserving your own comfort at the expense of ours.\n",
